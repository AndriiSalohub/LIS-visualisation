# LIS Visualisation

## Project Overview

LIS Visualisation is a web application designed to help users understand and interact with the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) algorithm through an intuitive visual representation. The platform offers both automatic and manual visualisation modes, enabling users to control the execution speed and create custom examples to explore the algorithm in depth.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with React.
- **Routing**: Managed with React Router DOM.
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight and efficient state handling.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI for accessible and customizable components.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent styling.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth and engaging transitions.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth and engaging transitions.
